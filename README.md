# Earth Brigade

Welcome fellow brigadiers!

As members of the Earth Brigade, the custodians of the Intergalactic Space Mall, it is imperative that you come prepared for your task ahead!

Since we are developing game in Unity and using GitHub for source control, here is some software you might need:
- Download [GitHub Desktop here](https://desktop.github.com/) if you don't already have it and want a GUI for interacting with GitHub instead of using the command line.
- Download [Unity Hub here](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) if you don't already have it so you can get the right version of the engine.
- Once you have Unity Hub downloaded and installed, sign in and install the following version of the engine: "Unity 2019.4.18f1 (LTS)". ![Go to Installs, Add, and version 2019.4.18f1](./logistics/Unity_Install.png)

Finally, our [Google Drive folder here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F0aosGHR669a8GViVXCHOLmrkaA2C0F3?usp=sharing) may be a more convenient a place for some things. We can use the Google Drive folder for anything that doesn't need to be in source control, like reference images. However, if it needs to be in game, then eventually it will need to be in the GitHub repository.
